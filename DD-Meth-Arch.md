# Design Decisions, Methodologies, Architectures

Design Decisions, Methodologies, Architectures for server side, client side and application deployment.

## Methodologies 

Although there are multiple methodologies we may apply including waterfall, prototyping, iterative and incremental development,
spiral development, rapid application development, extreme programming and agile. Most modern software development processes 
are a form of agile.

#### Agile Development

For the agile development, mainly there are two common methodologies, Kanban and Scrum.

###### Kanban

The definition of Kanban in wikipedia is "This approach aims to manage work by balancing the demands with available capacity, 
and improving the handling of system level bottlenecks ... Work is pulled as capacity permits, rather than work being pushed 
into the process when requested", which is more suitable for projects driven by the work force's availability.


###### Scrum

The definition of Scrum in wikipedia is "It is designed for teams of three to nine developers who break their work into
actions that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called sprints and track progress and re-plan in 15-minute 
stand-up meetings, called daily scrums ... enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location 
or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among all team members."
which is more suitable if you work as a team with predefined features in an iterative manner.



## Approaches

Viable alternatives are CRUD, DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing. And, if DDD is applied, each microservice may endup as a 
representation of a bounded context, so each may have a different approach.



## Strategies 

From a business perspective, cost as in the time and money to be spent for the product development, MVP is a well known
strategy for startups or high risk and prototypal product development.


##### Minimum viable product 

The definition of MVP in wikipedia is "A minimum viable product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to satisfy 
early customers, and to provide feedback for future product development. Gathering insights from an MVP is often less 
expensive than developing a product with more features, which increase costs and risk if the product fails, for example, 
due to incorrect assumptions"
