# Client Side Tools and Services


## Platform

Client-side application platforms are smartphones and tablets (iOS, Android), web application

#### Native vs Hybrid

For an application like Mergenie, as long as there are no performance issues, we could use native or hybrid development.

##### Native

The main impediment to native development is the diversity of programming languages, platforms, and APIs. 
There are viable solutions for native development that supports a single programming language and a platform
for multiple platforms, such as Xamarin, Unity, Qt, Kotlin Native.

Also, there are cross-platform native development tools and languages that are a bit different from the above solutions, 
like Native Script and React Native. 

##### Hybrid

The criticism for the Hybrid apps is performance issues and access to native functionality. Performance issues can be tackled with optimized Javascript, CSS, and HTML implementations, and, native functionality can be accessed using native plugins. 

##### Web

There are multiple web frameworks for Javascript, HTML, CSS with different approaches, regardless of technology, the web app should be a responsive (if possible PWA) web application. Currently, most preferred web application frameworks are Angular, React, and Vue. React and Vue are more component focused and they developers to use libraries for different functionalities, on the other hand, Angular has a more holistic approach.
